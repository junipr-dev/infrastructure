### Session: 2025-12-22 19:30 (Sync Setup Finalized)
**Accomplishments:**
- Abandoned Windows-native Syncthing/Tailscale approach (files in WSL require WSL running anyway)
- Reinstalled Syncthing + Tailscale in WSL on desktop
- Configured bidirectional sync between desktop and laptop
- Removed old Windows Tailscale entry, renamed WSL to jesse-desktop
- Cleaned up failed WSL auto-start attempts (Task Scheduler, VBScript)
- Created SYNC-SETUP.md documentation with full config details

**Commits Made:**
- study-buddy: "Update package-lock.json files" (06dc757)
- infrastructure: "Add desktop/laptop sync setup documentation" (9f622b3)

**Sync Config:**
- Desktop Tailscale: 100.125.236.116 (jesse-desktop)
- Laptop Tailscale: 100.78.98.78 (jesse-laptop)
- Desktop Syncthing ID: JZ33BAM-2R4H57F-NHNBK4U-NHEA4UJ-5HUXT5V-ESWXPJK-7HBKOCP-GGUCIAQ
- Laptop Syncthing ID: K42WERT-V243B4F-S47OD3C-CCUKUWG-LJZVYQR-GGHOJRE-QGVY7LA-QP727AB

**Notes:**
- WSL auto-start still not solved - user will try their own approach
- Sync works when WSL is running on both machines
- See infrastructure/SYNC-SETUP.md for full documentation

### Session: 2024-12-22 17:35 (WSL Auto-Start Fix v2)
**Status:** Rebooted - VBScript did NOT work

**Problem:** VBScript in Startup folder doesn't reliably start WSL

**Solution:** Use Task Scheduler with proper PowerShell command:
```powershell
# Run in PowerShell as Admin
schtasks /delete /tn "Start WSL" /f 2>$null
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "wsl.exe" -Argument "-d Ubuntu -- sleep infinity"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn -User "$env:USERNAME"
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -AllowStartIfOnBatteries -DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries -StartWhenAvailable
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "$env:USERNAME" -LogonType Interactive -RunLevel Limited
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Start WSL" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Settings $settings -Principal $principal -Description "Keep WSL running for Syncthing"
```

**Key fixes:**
- `sleep infinity` keeps WSL alive (old task exited immediately)
- AllowStartIfOnBatteries - works on laptop
- DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries - won't kill when unplugged
- StartWhenAvailable - runs if missed

**After reboot, verify with:**
- Check if WSL is running without opening terminal
- `wsl -l -v` in PowerShell should show Ubuntu running
- Syncthing should be accessible at http://localhost:8384

**Cleanup:** Delete useless VBScript:
```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\start-wsl.vbs"
```

---

### Session: 2024-12-22 17:15 (WSL Auto-Start Fix)
**Accomplishments:**
- Fixed Syncthing not auto-starting on Windows login
  - Root cause: WSL doesn't start until terminal is opened, even with systemd enabled
  - Created VBScript startup script: `start-wsl.vbs` in Windows Startup folder
  - Script silently runs `wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -- sleep infinity` to keep WSL alive
- Reviewed session status and all repository states

**Files Created:**
- `/mnt/c/Users/Jesse/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/start-wsl.vbs`

**Commits Made:**
- dealscout: "Add mobile package-lock.json" (976d1e6)

**Next Session:**
1. Verify WSL auto-start works after reboot
2. If working, verify Syncthing starts automatically
3. Continue with SaveState/DealScout work

**Context for Next Session (if auto-start fails):**
- VBScript location: `C:\Users\Jesse\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\start-wsl.vbs`
- Script content: `objShell.Run "wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -- sleep infinity", 0, False`
- The old Task Scheduler "Start WSL" task was broken because:
  - It ran `wsl -d Ubuntu` without a command, so WSL started and immediately exited
  - Had `No Start On Batteries` restriction (bad for laptop)
  - Last Result was -1 (failure)
- Task Scheduler task should be deleted (needs admin: `schtasks /delete /tn "Start WSL" /f`)
- If VBScript doesn't work, alternatives:
  1. Fix Task Scheduler: `wsl -d Ubuntu -- sleep infinity` with battery restriction removed
  2. Use native Windows Syncthing (no WSL dependency)
  3. Use both VBScript + Task Scheduler for redundancy

- Allows switching between Claude/Codex/Gemini at any time in any project
- `/end-session` and `/end-day` automatically sync project-level context files

**Pending Tasks:**
- [ ] Delete old command files (session-start.md, wrap-session.md, eod.md) if they still exist
- [ ] Delete sync-context.md (not needed - sync happens in /end-session)
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Test the renamed commands

**Next:**
- Commit infrastructure repo changes
- Commit CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md
- Verify symlinks are correct
- Create project-level context files for existing projects (Junipr, etc.)

### Session: 2024-12-18 15:30
**Accomplishments:**
- Created comprehensive repository management system
- Added auto-detection of all git repos (not hardcoded list)
- Created `/check-repos` command with intelligent health checks
- Created `/wrap-session` command for end-of-session cleanup
- Created `/eod` command for complete end-of-day workflow
- Created `/session-start` command for beginning new sessions
- Updated all commands to include session notes tracking
- Added session notes files to global .gitignore
- Updated CLAUDE.md with agent protocol and slash command workflow
- Updated infrastructure README.md
- Hidden all dotfiles in Windows Explorer for cleaner view

**Commands Created:**
- `/start-session` - Start new session with context from last session
- `/check-repos` - Auto-detect and check all repos for issues
- `/end-session` - Commit, push, update session notes
- `/end-day` - Complete end-of-day workflow

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/jesse/CLAUDE.md` - Added agent protocol section
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/README.md` - Updated command list
- `/home/jesse/dotfiles/git/.gitignore_global` - Added session notes
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/scripts/check-all-repos.sh` - Created
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/check-repos.md` - Created
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/wrap-session.md` - Created
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/eod.md` - Created
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/session-start.md` - Created

**Pending Tasks:**
- [ ] Recreate symlinks in `~/.claude/commands/` (bash shell broken)
- [ ] Commit changes to infrastructure repo
- [ ] Commit changes to dotfiles repo
- [ ] Commit changes to CLAUDE.md

**Next Steps:**
1. User needs to manually run these commands to fix symlinks:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   rm -rf .claude/commands/*
   ln -sf ~/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/*.md .claude/commands/
   ```
2. Test the new commands
3. Commit everything

**Notes:**
- Bash shell broke when `/home/jesse/utilities/` was deleted (was current directory)
- All commands moved to `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/`
- Session notes system uses `.session-notes.md` for project-specific, `SESSION-NOTES.md` for global
- Commands auto-detect which file to use based on context

## Session: 2025-12-31 (Evening - SSH & Machine Access Setup)

### Accomplished
- Removed `/home/jesse/dotfiles` folder (redundant - configs already in place in home dir)
- Updated global context files to remove dotfiles references
- **Set up bidirectional SSH access between dev-lab and DESKTOP:**
  - Enabled OpenSSH Server on DESKTOP (Windows 11)
  - Added dev-lab's public key to DESKTOP's authorized_keys
  - Created `ssh desktop` alias on dev-lab (192.168.99.145)
  - Can now make changes to DESKTOP remotely when user requests
- **Set up DESKTOP → VPS SSH access:**
  - Added DESKTOP's public key to VPS authorized_keys
  - Created `ssh vps` alias on DESKTOP
- **Documented machine access strategy in CLAUDE.md:**
  - Auto-detection via SSH source IP (192.168.99.145 = DESKTOP, 100.x.x.x = LAPTOP/MOBILE)
  - DESKTOP: Local ethernet, direct SSH access
  - LAPTOP: Tailscale-only (simpler, works same-LAN and remote)
  - MOBILE: Tailscale for services, no SSH back
  - App testing considerations (Expo/hot reload fine over Tailscale on same LAN)

### Public Keys Saved
- DESKTOP: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINbhEJtF/lZpKsEeMABjtQvbfE5/2QvHrxQg3wO/I2XZ jesse@desktop`
- LAPTOP: (to be configured)

### SSH Config Updates
- dev-lab `~/.ssh/config`: Added `Host desktop` entry
- DESKTOP `~/.ssh/config`: Added `Host vps` entry (via SCP from dev-lab)

### Naming Convention Established
- Always use DESKTOP/LAPTOP/MOBILE (not "Windows 11", "Windows 10", etc.)

### Commits Made
- infrastructure: pulled updates from remote (SESSION-NOTES.md, DEV-LAB-MIGRATION.md)

### Pending
- [ ] Set up LAPTOP SSH access when ready (get Tailscale IP + public key)

### Next Session
1. Configure LAPTOP when user is ready
2. Test SSH access from different machines

## Session: 2025-12-31 (Late Night)

### Accomplished
- Verified GPU hardware transcoding is working on Plex with P1000
  - NVDEC (decode) + NVENC (encode) confirmed active
  - nvidia-smi shows no processes inside Docker but GPU memory usage confirms activity
- Updated global context sync method to use faster cp + sed approach
- Synced all agent context files (CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md)

### Previous Session Work (2025-12-31)
- Fixed GPU transcoding by installing nvidia-vaapi-driver
- Disabled Plex trailers (IVA bug with empty stream URLs)
- Created CAM/Telesync blocking custom format in Radarr
- Disabled 1337x (rate limiting) and RuTracker (geo-blocked)
- Documented Disk 2 health warning (8 bad sectors)

### Repository Status
- All repos clean and pushed
- homelab: up to date
- infrastructure: up to date
- projects: up to date
- junipr: up to date
- itsjesse.dev: has untracked portfolio dirs (intentional WIP)
- dotfiles: not present on dev-lab VM

### Next Session
- Consider replacing Disk 2 before failure
- Test more transcoding scenarios to ensure GPU stability
- Review untracked portfolio projects in itsjesse.dev

### Notes
- GPU transcoding only activates when video re-encoding is needed
- Audio transcoding is always CPU-based (normal)
- Direct play/stream doesn't use GPU (optimal behavior)
