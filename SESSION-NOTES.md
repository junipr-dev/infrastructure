**Key Commands for Next Session:**
```bash
# Start Metro
cd ~/projects/cakebuddy/app && npx react-native start --host 0.0.0.0

# In another terminal, set up adb reverse (if needed)
/mnt/c/Users/Jesse/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081

# Launch app
/mnt/c/Users/Jesse/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe shell am start -n com.cakebuddy/.MainActivity
```

**Notes:**
- First build takes 30-45 mins (compiles C++ for 4 architectures)
- Subsequent builds are fast (2-3 mins) due to caching
- Hot reload works - code changes appear instantly
- Added cost optimization rule to global CLAUDE.md (use haiku/sonnet when possible)

### Session: 2024-12-18 16:45
**Accomplishments:**
- Created AGENTS.md (Codex context file) matching CLAUDE.md
- Created GEMINI.md (Gemini context file) matching CLAUDE.md
- Added synchronization rules to all three agent context files (system-wide AND project-level)
- Renamed slash commands for consistency:
  - `/session-start` → `/start-session`
  - `/wrap-session` → `/end-session`
  - `/eod` → `/end-day`
- Updated all command files with new names
- Updated `/start-session` to handle first-time use (no session notes yet)
- Updated `/end-session` and `/end-day` to automatically sync project-level context files
- Clarified that context file sync applies at BOTH system-wide and project levels
- Updated all references in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, infrastructure README, SESSION-NOTES.md
- User fixed symlinks manually (bash was broken)

**Files Created:**
- `/home/jesse/AGENTS.md` - Global Codex context
- `/home/jesse/GEMINI.md` - Global Gemini context
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/start-session.md`
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/end-session.md`
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/end-day.md`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/jesse/CLAUDE.md` - Added sync rules for both global and project levels
- `/home/jesse/AGENTS.md` - Added sync rules for both global and project levels
- `/home/jesse/GEMINI.md` - Added sync rules for both global and project levels
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/README.md` - Updated command names
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/SESSION-NOTES.md` - Updated references
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/start-session.md` - Added first-time disclaimer
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/end-session.md` - Added automatic context sync
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/end-day.md` - Added automatic context sync

**Key Insight:**
- Context files needed at BOTH levels: system-wide `/home/jesse/` AND project-level `<project-root>/`
- Allows switching between Claude/Codex/Gemini at any time in any project
- `/end-session` and `/end-day` automatically sync project-level context files

**Pending Tasks:**
- [ ] Delete old command files (session-start.md, wrap-session.md, eod.md) if they still exist
- [ ] Delete sync-context.md (not needed - sync happens in /end-session)
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Test the renamed commands

**Next:**
- Commit infrastructure repo changes
- Commit CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md
- Verify symlinks are correct
- Create project-level context files for existing projects (Junipr, etc.)

- [ ] Commit changes to infrastructure repo
- [ ] Commit changes to dotfiles repo
- [ ] Commit changes to CLAUDE.md

**Next Steps:**
1. User needs to manually run these commands to fix symlinks:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   rm -rf .claude/commands/*
   ln -sf ~/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/*.md .claude/commands/
   ```
2. Test the new commands
3. Commit everything

**Notes:**
- Bash shell broke when `/home/jesse/utilities/` was deleted (was current directory)
- All commands moved to `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/`
- Session notes system uses `.session-notes.md` for project-specific, `SESSION-NOTES.md` for global
- Commands auto-detect which file to use based on context
