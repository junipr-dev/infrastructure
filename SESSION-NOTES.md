---

### Session: 2024-12-18 16:45
**Accomplishments:**
- Created AGENTS.md (Codex context file) matching CLAUDE.md
- Created GEMINI.md (Gemini context file) matching CLAUDE.md
- Added synchronization rules to all three agent context files (system-wide AND project-level)
- Renamed slash commands for consistency:
  - `/session-start` → `/start-session`
  - `/wrap-session` → `/end-session`
  - `/eod` → `/end-day`
- Updated all command files with new names
- Updated `/start-session` to handle first-time use (no session notes yet)
- Updated `/end-session` and `/end-day` to automatically sync project-level context files
- Clarified that context file sync applies at BOTH system-wide and project levels
- Updated all references in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, infrastructure README, SESSION-NOTES.md
- User fixed symlinks manually (bash was broken)

**Files Created:**
- `/home/jesse/AGENTS.md` - Global Codex context
- `/home/jesse/GEMINI.md` - Global Gemini context
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/start-session.md`
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/end-session.md`
- `/home/jesse/infrastructure/system-utilities/claude-commands/end-day.md`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/jesse/CLAUDE.md` - Added sync rules for both global and project levels
- `/home/jesse/AGENTS.md` - Added sync rules for both global and project levels

**Key Insight:**
- Context files needed at BOTH levels: system-wide `/home/jesse/` AND project-level `<project-root>/`
- Allows switching between Claude/Codex/Gemini at any time in any project
- `/end-session` and `/end-day` automatically sync project-level context files

**Pending Tasks:**
- [ ] Delete old command files (session-start.md, wrap-session.md, eod.md) if they still exist
- [ ] Delete sync-context.md (not needed - sync happens in /end-session)
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Test the renamed commands

**Next:**
- Commit infrastructure repo changes
- Commit CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md
- Verify symlinks are correct
